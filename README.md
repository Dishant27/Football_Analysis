- **Relative Value Assessment**: Cost-effectiveness analysis across leagues

### Team Building

- **Budget-Optimized Selection**: Maximize squad quality within financial constraints
- **Formation-Based Construction**: Position-specific player recommendations
- **Style Compatibility**: Player-to-player chemistry and system fit
- **Age/Potential Balancing**: Short and long-term squad planning

### Predictive Modeling

- **Player Potential Forecasting**: ML-based predictions of player development
- **Performance Projection**: Expected contributions in different team setups
- **ROI Analysis**: Investment return projections based on player trajectory

## üìä Data & Methodology

### Data Sources

- **Professional Scouting Reports**: In-depth player evaluations from experts
- **Match Performance Data**: Detailed statistics from official competitions
- **Physical Metrics**: Speed, stamina, strength, and agility measurements
- **Technical Attributes**: Passing accuracy, shooting efficiency, defensive actions
- **Contract Information**: Salary details, contract length, release clauses
- **Market Valuations**: Transfer fee estimates and historical transaction data
- **Injury Records**: Historical injury data and recovery timelines
- **Team Performance Context**: How players perform within different team setups

### Analysis Techniques

- **Clustering Analysis**: Grouping similar players by performance profiles
- **Regression Modeling**: Projecting future performance and potential
- **Optimization Algorithms**: Maximizing squad efficiency under constraints
- **Visualization**: Interactive plots for performance comparison

## üìà Sample Visualizations

### Player Potential vs Overall Rating

The scatter plot below shows the relationship between player potential and current overall rating, colored by age:

## üíª Implementation

```python
# Sample code for player selection optimization

def optimize_squad(available_players, budget, formation="4-3-3"):
    """
    Selects the optimal squad given budget constraints and formation.
    
    Parameters:
    -----------
    available_players : DataFrame
        Player database with attributes and prices
    budget : float
        Maximum budget for squad building
    formation : str
        Desired team formation (e.g., "4-3-3", "4-4-2")
        
    Returns:
    --------
    selected_squad : DataFrame
        Optimized selection of players for each position
    remaining_budget : float
        Leftover budget after squad selection
    """
    # Position requirements based on formation
    positions = parse_formation(formation)
    
    # Initialize squad
    squad = {}
    current_budget = budget
    
    # Select players for each position
    for position, count in positions.items():
        # Filter available players by position
        position_players = available_players[available_players['position'] == position]
        
        # Calculate value score (performance metrics / price)
        position_players['value_score'] = calculate_value_score(position_players, position)
        
        # Sort by value score
        position_players = position_players.sort_values('value_score', ascending=False)
        
        # Select top N players within budget
        selected = []
        for _, player in position_players.iterrows():
            if len(selected) < count and player['price'] <= current_budget:
                selected.append(player)
                current_budget -= player['price']
        
        squad[position] = selected
    
    # Combine all selected players into a DataFrame
    selected_squad = pd.concat([pd.DataFrame(players) for players in squad.values()])
    
    return selected_squad, current_budget
```
